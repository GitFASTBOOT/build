Should the engineer stop and fix GSI first?\n\nThere\u0027s also this thread ag/9554048.\n\nAnd yes I told SzuWei that we should just update this manually time to time, as we are breaking / fixing GSI constantly anyway ðŸ˜œ",

I\u0027m happy as long as this is not empty.\n\notoh, I\u0027m still not convinced to add \"current\". For example if \"current\" means \"the same value as PLATFORM_SDK_VERSION\", then this may add additional burden to the person updating PLATFORM_SDK_VERSION, which is a situation we don\u0027t want to happen. We could maybe set this to a large value like 100, then it would function sorta like \"latest\" without adding additional dependencies / changes around the SHIPPING_API_LEVEL logic. wdyt?",

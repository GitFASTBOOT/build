      "message": "Thanks for the review!\n\nTo give some context: I included the \"building_vendor_image\" \u003d\u003d \"true\" conditional with the detection of the path, since I felt that both needed to be true in order to build an image. Whereas the presence of an already built image I think implies that the build is using a prebuilt image for a given partition.\n\nAlso, when we use a prebuilt image we don\u0027t seem set the build_*_image flag in the makefiles: https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:build/make/core/board_config.mk;l\u003d433\n\nI\u0027m happy to add a warning for that combination of flags, but it does seem like that is intentionally done in the prebuilt scenario.",

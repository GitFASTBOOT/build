      "message": "The issue is that I don\u0027t understand why sdk-core-lambda-stubs exists / is different from core-lambda-stubs.\n\nhttp://aosp/492539 suggests that it\u0027s just a prebuilt version of core-lambda-stubs from a particular historic build, so perhaps it should be replaced when the core-lambda-stubs definition changes. But, since I don\u0027t understand why the prebuilts exist, I don\u0027t know whether we\u0027d then also need a prebuilt core-lambda-stubs-extra-deps, or whether it\u0027d be fine to depend on that one in source form?\n\n\nAnyway, I just had another idea:\n\nInstead of \n (a) changing the definition of core-lambda-stubs by moving the extra-deps out into their own target, vs.\n (b) I could leave the definition of core-lambda-stubs unchanged and instead introduce a new java_library \"core-lambda-stubs-without-extra-deps\" that contains just the parts that core-lambda-stubs would have needed under (a)? Then I can change the definition of core-platform-api-stubs-system-modules to depend on core-lambda-stubs-without-extra-deps without affecting anything else.\n\nI think (b) is the safer alternative, and can be done in a single libcore CL. I have to go home now, but I\u0027ll try that tomorrow and will probably drop this CL topic.",

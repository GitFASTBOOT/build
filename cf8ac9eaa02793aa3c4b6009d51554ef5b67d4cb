      "message": "If I understand this change correctly, now when the developer issues `m` command, compression of the whole OS image will be skipped. This is good, however, I am not convinced that `pack_image` should be called at all during `m` invocation as it makes the build longer, and usually developers use OTA (via `update-device`) to apply changes to their device. If a developer wants the whole image it can always issue `pack_image` itself.",

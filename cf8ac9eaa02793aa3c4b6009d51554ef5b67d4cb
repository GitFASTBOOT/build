      "message": "If I understand this change correctly, now when the developer issues `m` command, compression of the whole OS image will be skipped. This is good, however, I am not convinced that `pack_image` should be called at all during `m` invocation as it makes the build longer, and usually developers use OTA (via `update-device`) to apply changes to their device. If a developer wants the whole image it can always issue `pack_image` itself.",

      "message": "\u003e On Android, an unadorned m is usually the command to build the flashable filesystem images\n\nI believe this will be true in our case once we implement fastboot without any changes to how Android does `m` right now. Because we don\u0027t have that yet, we implemented `pack_image` script so that all partitions are bundled into a single image that can be flashed onto an USB stick. However, `pack_image` even without compression takes time and usually developers have to flash the whole image only once. Then, they can use OTA (via `update-device`) to get their changes applied onto the device, so `pack_image` is not invoked most of the time. I am just wondering if we really need to invoke `pack_image` during `m` at all. I\u0027m going to +1 this (especially as your CL reduces `m` time by excluding compression), I just think that we could go further and remove `pack_image` from `m` entirely. I\u0027ll let @mwojtas@google.com decide.",

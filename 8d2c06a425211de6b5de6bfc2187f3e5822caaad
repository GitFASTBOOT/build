      "message": "\u003e so you\u0027re sure you want this to be a BoardConfig variable rather than a product variable?\n\nI am not sure actually. What\u0027s the difference between it being BoardConfig vs Product variable? If it\u0027s a boardconfig, products will not be able to configure it?\n\nContext about how I came up with this CL:\n\nI was just imitating TARGET_FLATTEN_APEX flag. APEX are by default flattened and device needs to configure their product configuration to unflatten them.\n\nSo I crated TARGET_COMPRESSED_APEX which by default will be false and device will configure their product if they want to enable it. I thought since products can configure TARGET_FLATTEN_APEX, they should be able to configure TARGET_COMPRESSED_APEX.",

      "message": "There is a split in the config system between device configs (BoardConfig) and product configs that use these devices. It used to be \"how to compile\" vs \"what to compile\", so with that in mind it kind of fits like a BoardConfig, but if you want to enable having different settings for different products it should be a product variable instead\n\n+joe, sasha, does this distinction make sense in your new system?",

      "message": "\u003e so you\u0027re sure you want this to be a BoardConfig variable rather than a product variable?\n\nI am not sure actually. What\u0027s the difference between it being BoardConfig vs Product variable? If it\u0027s a boardconfig, products will not be able to configure it?\n\nContext about how I came up with this CL:\n\nI was just imitating TARGET_FLATTEN_APEX flag. APEX are by default flattened and device needs to configure their product configuration to unflatten them.\n\nSo I crated TARGET_COMPRESSED_APEX which by default will be false and device will configure their product if they want to enable it. I thought since products can configure TARGET_FLATTEN_APEX, they should be able to configure TARGET_COMPRESSED_APEX.",

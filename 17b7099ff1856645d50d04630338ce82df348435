I believe I\u0027ve addressed them but let me know:\n\n* It now checks that \u0027use_dynamic_partitions\u0027 is set for both.\n* I added verifying that dynamic_partition_list and super_partition_groups don\u0027t come from the system misc_info.txt in validate_config_lists()\n* I added a comment to make it clear that super partition groups and sizes come from the other misc_info, to allow per-board variation for a shared system image. I also added verifying that the other misc_info contains super_*_group_size for each partition group.",

We could get a prebuilt checked in, but that\u0027s not something I\u0027m going to have time to do any time soon.\n\nIf I removed this from the docs target and just left it as ndk-docs, would that be okay for now? People that need to run it could invoke the ndk-docs target and just be expected to get it from apt (though I\u0027m not sure this is any better than just leaving it as a manually invoked makefile in frameworks/native/docs).",

While the creation of the bootImageConfig structs is done in a static context as you say the rules to create the boot image are now generated in art-bootclasspath-fragment and platform-bootclasspath.\n\n\u003e Or if we get rid of PRODUCT_UPDATABLE_BOOT_JARS all together b/191686720, then this stops being a problem.\n\nThat was what I was assuming would allow this to be removed but there was no todo here.",

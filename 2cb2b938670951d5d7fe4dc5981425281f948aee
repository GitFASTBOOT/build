      "message": "Ahh I finally figured out that click gets the comment box. I got so used to the + on github and haven\u0027t visited Gerrit in awhile so forgive me. So my only concern is around what Tom also mentioned. I think I\u0027d like logic out of the Makefile and into the python script. Can we just quote this and handle the empty string in the pythons script?",

      "message": "Is this change correct?  Does it handle the files in rootdir correctly?  The top path, meant for the system partition returns True by default without checking if the path starts with \u0027system\u0027, so it will label things such as init.* in the rootdir.  If there are no other partitions, and this goes into the 2nd path, it will skip these.",

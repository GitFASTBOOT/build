      "message": "Hi David,\n\nAnother thing is that... Could we bump up lz4 version to 1.9.3?\n1.9.2 has some issue when doing fixed-sized output compression for zeroed data.\n1.9.3 has fixed this, and it has already been deployed to many Linux distributions...\n\nThanks,\nGao Xiang",

      "message": "( https://github.com/lz4/lz4/releases/tag/v1.9.3 for reference )\n\u003e The high compression variant LZ4_compress_HC_destSize() would miss some important opportunities in highly compressible data, resulting in less than optimal compression. This is fixed in this version. Even the \"fast\" variant receives some gains (albeit very small).",

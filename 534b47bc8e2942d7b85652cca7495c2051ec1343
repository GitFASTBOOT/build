      "message": "The reason for this change is because [`deviceConfig.HideFlaggedApis()`](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:build/soong/android/config.go;drc\u003d8c4387e478eebe3b3b9fcf28f5a12cea1510890b;l\u003d2124) is currently determined by the two variables: `NextReleaseHideFlaggedApi()` and `ReleaseExposeFlaggedApi()`, which is confusing because the namings are similar. However, the former is currently used to determine if the target product is a sdk variant, while the latter is a build flag that determines if the target release is `next`.\n\n\n\u003e The latter is used in build/soong/cc, and is a module-level qualifier instead of a build-level qualifier\n\nThanks for pointing this out, I was not aware of this. However, since the preexisting variable is a module property(used as `module.IsSdkVariant()`) while the new variable is a product variable (used as `ctx.deviceConfig.IsSdkVariant()`), I do not believe that this would cause confusion.\n\nI\u0027d appreciate it if you can share your thoughts!",

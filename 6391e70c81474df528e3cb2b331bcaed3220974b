      "message": "The reason I put in EMMA_INSTRUMENT was because I see that JACOCO_REPORT_CLASSES_ALL which is used the same way as this .json file.\nI moved it outside of EMMA_INSTRUMENT (here and down below) but kept it in TARGET_BUILD_APPS. Allen mentioned to me that there might be something related to mainline modules so we might want to keep it in TARGET_BUILD_APPS?\nI\u0027m actually very new to the platform world, so please let me know if you have any suggestions / how it looks now. Thanks.",

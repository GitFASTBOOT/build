The "generic_arm_a" product defines a non-hardware-specific non-A/B
arm target without a bootloader, kernel, or other vendor dependency.

It's an experimental product and should be merged into generic_arm
after the experiemnt is done.

It is not a product "base class"; no other products inherit
from it or use it in any way.

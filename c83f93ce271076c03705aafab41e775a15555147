Static libraries compiled in soong do not create a coverage zip, and thus any Android.mk that includes a soong-built static library is missing the .gcno files from the static library.\n\nSoong-built shared libraries and executables already include the .gcno files from any static libraries in their own coverage zip, so the only missing data is when we cross from a soong-built static library to an Android.mk-built module.",

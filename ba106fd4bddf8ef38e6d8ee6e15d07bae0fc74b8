      "message": "It seems like this may be conflating where things are installed vs which APIs they\u0027re built against.\n\nLOCAL_JAVA_LIBRARIES does not necessarily imply a runtime dependency on a specific java library, it\u0027s just saying that something presenting the same API will exist at some point in the future (either via a library in the bootclasspath, or later integrated into another java package with LOCAL_STATIC_JAVA_LIBRARIES).\n\nWhile we do need to protect against java:system -\u003e java:platform linking, I\u0027m not sure the build system is ready to say much about vendor -\u003e system usage outside of that. I wish it was, but I don\u0027t think we\u0027ve modeled the necessary relationships.\n\nThe current static vs shared java library linkages are significantly misused currently --\n multiple copies of the same library (or multiple versions of the same library ðŸ˜®) can be embedded into the same end apk/jar/dex. We\u0027ll only have one of the same class, hopefully we pick well enough...",

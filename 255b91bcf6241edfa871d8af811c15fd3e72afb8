LOCAL_PREBUILT_MODULE_FILE is generally a source file for Android.mk files, and for Android.bp files I\u0027d expect it to get copied to ALL_MODULES.$(my_register_name).BUILT, so I\u0027m not sure what purpose adding it serves.",

      "message": "I don\u0027t know why you think that. To get into `$(ALL_MODULES.$(my_register_name).BUILT)` it would have to get into `LOCAL_BUILT_MODULE`, and that gets constructed from `LOCAL_BUILT_MODULE_STEM` and other things. The LOCAL_PREBUILT_MODULE_FILE is treated more like a src property.\n\nI believe the root of the problem is an implicit BUILT-\u003eINSTALLED copy that happens between Soong and Make, which ordinarily would have it\u0027s own `meta_lic` file, but instead just gets a copy of the Soong `meta_lic` from elsewhere.\n\nPointing the LOCAL_PREBUILT_MODULE_FILE target\u0027s `meta_lic` at the copied license metadata resolves the problem.",

I\u0027d suggest creating a more specific property for your use case and moving tests over to it, otherwise it is very hard to interpret the various ways different modules use `required`.",

      "message": "I wonder if you mean to create a new property in Soong modules(android_test, java_test, etc) and declare dependencies in there instead of `required`? If yes, can we move the dependencies declared in `required` into other existing attribute such as `data`? If no, could you provide an example for more details?\n\nBesides, we won\u0027t build anything around `required`. We just want to get the dependencies in `required` and add the dependencies into a more general attribute(not specific for required) in Bazel definitions.",

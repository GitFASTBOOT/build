      "message": "I did a build with UNSAFE_DISABLE_HIDDENAPI_FLAGS\u003dfalse and couldn\u0027t find any modules that actually triggered this line, and so conveniently decided to put it in app_prebuilt_internal.mk and call it a day. Now that I look at the code again, this code actually seems to be meaningless?\n\nThe only place that non_system_module is set is here:\nhttp://cs/android/build/make/core/base_rules.mk?l\u003d99\u0026rcl\u003db378d4d0a580322de710feb35f16d1bb114e6ba2\n\nbut, base_rules.mk is included below, in line 127, which means non_system_module is always empty here?\n\nWDYT?",

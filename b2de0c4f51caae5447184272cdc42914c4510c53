      "message": "The \"custom image\" is a predefined name in Android. The custom images are prebuilt when make android \"droid\" images. But they are source code in overall Android view.  They are usually built by \"make custom_images\" command. Makefile is make/core/tasks/build_custom_images.mk. Because of this, Bowgo and I think \"custom images\" here is more accurate.",

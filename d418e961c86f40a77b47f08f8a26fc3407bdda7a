      "message": "I\u0027m not sure if the broken configuration (sdk_* targets) should instead include build/target/product/default_art_config.mk, which ensures that PRODUCT_BOOT_JARS include ART_APEX_JARS. It may be a more correct fix. But I don\u0027t know enough about SDK builds to be sure if they are supposed to build ART boot images and anything related to dexpreopt (if yes, then they need default_art_config.mk).\n",

      "message": "The broken configuration is sdk_phone_x86_vendor. The key is the _vendor part. sdk_phone_x86 worked fine. The sdk_phone_x86_vendor did not. That is because it is only intended to build the vendor.img (don\u0027t know why) and so purposely does not include anything in the PRODUCT_BOOT_JARS.\n\nI\u0027m wondering whether instead of passing in ArtApexJars separately to the dexpreopt.GlobalConfig it should be computed by extracting any jars that start with com.android.art:",

This change is a stepping stone to putting all of that into the build system a la aiuto@\u0027s v2 stuff.\n\nThe stepping stone there would be to put the information in the Android.mk / Android.bp file, not the METADATA file which we won\u0027t parse at soong/make time (just like Bazel requires it to be in the BUILD file and not the METADATA file last I checked).\n\n\u003e I don\u0027t see how dyndep would work for the tarball because it kind of has 2 dependency lists: a list of files and a list of directories. But that particular makefile doesn\u0027t do anything until you explicitly request the tarball output so calling shell from there does no harm.\n\nThe dyndep would have a dependency on the list of every METADATA file, then it would parse them and output the dependency list (\u003cgpl\u003e/**/*) and the list of directories in a file for the gpl_source_tgz rule to read and generate the tarball.\n\n\u003e move the shell call to collect_gpl_sources.mk\n\nThat wouldn\u0027t help, that makefile is always included.\n\n\u003e It looks like the gnu module stuff only gets run for is_sdk_build.

But I suspect it still ends up being similar overall performance -- you just end up with one larger execution rather than many smaller ones. Limiting it to when you\u0027re building the sdk helps, but that\u0027s really only hiding the problem.",

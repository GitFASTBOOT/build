Do you actually want to check a line match if you already parsed one for a particular prev_rustc_warning? I guess I am just pedantic about things like this (i.e. unnecessarily checking subsequent lines for Rust file/line info, when we have already processed it).\n\nHonestly, this line should probably check if prev_rustc_warning is set and then notify us that there is some weird warning pattern with no file/line info. Right now, those will just get ignored entirely. I think I would prefer to see this moved up, with a check here instead.",

      "message": "Hey :)\n\nWhile looking over the C++ flags generated code I noticed something I think we should fix. It adds an include from libbase, but server_configurable_flags already depends on libbase so I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a big change.\n\nDo you know if the generated code is tested/in use anywhere? I was a bit suspicious of how quick the build ran.\n\nptal and let me know what you think, thanks!",

      "message": "This is one case, some other cases might also cause digest mismatch between the digest calculated here (vbmeta_digest.txt) v.s. the digest calculated by the bootloader at runtime.\n\ne.g.,\n\n1. system-only OTA (a.k.a. Vendor Freeze)\n   https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-SPW3iF47wL0gGdDsnkN3Jg-T-Vdmf1YN093OYMnlCI/edit#slide\u003did.g5bcc607afa_0_19\n\n2. Build split. Some partners have a repo manifest that only build system/system_ext/product and another repo manifest build for vendor.img/boot.img, etc.  Then merge the build later with different combinations.\n\n./build/make/tools/releasetools/merge_builds.py\n./build/make/tools/releasetools/merge_target_files.py\n\nJust wonder how the vbmeta_digest.txt will be used.\n\nWhy not just use the digest value calculated by the bootloader at runtime?",

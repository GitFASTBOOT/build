      "message": "TARGET_NO_BOOTLOADER is now required to be set for all configurations. This is handled by the fact that it is defined in the generic BoardConfig.mk\u0027s (i.e. https://android.googlesource.com/device/generic/arm64/+/refs/heads/master/BoardConfig.mk, https://android.googlesource.com/device/generic/x86_64/+/refs/heads/master/BoardConfig.mk are the most relevant, and a few others).\nAssuming partners inherit from those generic BoardConfigs, they\u0027ll be fine. \n\nIn the case of the breakages, a partner did not inherit from those BoardConfigs in the interest of reducing their memory footprints and I updated their board config \nto define TARGET_NO_BOOTLOADER to true.\n\nWRT your second question, no they don\u0027t know. I would expect all partners to be inheriting from the generic BoardConfig.mk. I can follow up with partner eng to include this in documentation if you\u0027d prefer.",

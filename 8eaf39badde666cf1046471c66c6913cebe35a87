      "message": "Thanks for writing the cl..  \nThe current variable naming is indeed confusing, as the care_map generation code actually cares about the total blocks of that partition on device. https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:build/make/tools/releasetools/common.py?l\u003d3860\n\nSo we want to save the partition size on device here. And this output size is inaccurate for non-raw images (e.g. sparse image). For raw images, will there be a difference between the blocks occupation of this file on host VS the image size flashed on device? (I am not familiar with the difference between du -k vs ls, maybe it\u0027s the same if the size is aligned)",

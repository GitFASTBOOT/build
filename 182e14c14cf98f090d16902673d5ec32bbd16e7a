      "message": "Local tests show that only generating the xml for coverage reports is substantially faster than generating both html and xml outputs. Once this runs through presubmit, we ought to be able to determine whether that\u0027s true in that environment as well.\n\nThis should only be merged if the html output of these coverage reports are never used. I\u0027m not sure they are, but I couldn\u0027t find their use in any automated systems. If they are used, perhaps they could be generated by a different job, in which case some of the deletions in this patch shouldn\u0027t land -- but we can still take those reports off the critical path.",

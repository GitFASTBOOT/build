# Downstream Issues

This is a centralized location to document changes to the build and to provide
scripts to fix them. Files should be named:

<year>-<month>-<day>-<description>.<ext>

The date corresponds to roughly when the breaking change was introduced to the
Android build. If a script to fix the problem is possible, that is included.
Otherwise, a description of the change is included.

## Reporting a Problem

Please upload a CL on aosp/master to this location or contact the author of the
change file.

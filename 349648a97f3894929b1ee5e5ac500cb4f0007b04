      "message": "We have a policy to provide notices for a bunch of license types.\n\nIf we were dealing only with Soong and/or Bazel, we could change the conditions on the license kinds easily enough to include a notice condition on all of the permissive and restricted etc. license kinds. But we are also dealing with Make.\n\nIn Make, the conditions are explicitly listed. If we could roll back time a year, the large-scale-change could have included a notice condition on all the restricted and permissive license kinds, but we cannot roll back time. And the large scale change did not add a notice condition for other license kinds.\n\nTo indicate that the required action is to display a notice and to properly handle propagation from target to dependency, which happens for restricted source-sharing but does not happen for notices, the non-notice conditions that trigger notices need to be renamed in this context.",

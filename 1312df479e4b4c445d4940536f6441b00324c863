      "message": "It is a mechanism by which we can indicate the module type like soong_cc_binary or soong_cc_prebuilt or blueprint_go_binary etc.\n\nOf course, to actually use it, we first have to either set it from Soong\u0027s mk interface, or update the various included files to set it before including base_rules.mk\n\nI figured we could defer that work until we need to write a policy that requires knowing certain module types, and we could start by setting it for those types first.",

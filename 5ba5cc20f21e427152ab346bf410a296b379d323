      "message": "The flag id is used at two locations in the build system. First, the codegen uses it, it uses flag id to know where within package is this flag stored. Then it is used by storage mechanism to create flag value files in this order. It is crucial to have these two orders match exactly.\n\nCan we runtime assign id at both locations: yes. But the biggest fear is two sources of truth and they may silently diverge and it is hard to detect that. Rather it is much more robust to have it created as a part of cache, thus single source of truth, and strict consistency between codegen and storage creation.",

      "message": "For example, assuming we are not adding this id field. During codegen, say we assign flag ids in a way that foo is 0 and bar is 1. So the generated code expects foo\u0027s value is before bar\u0027s value. But during storage file creation, we assigned foo to flag id 1 and bar to flag id 0. So bar is value appeared before foo\u0027s value in storage file. Then the generated code for foo is actually getting bar\u0027s value.\n\nSuch errors are silent and hard to guard and debug. If we have the id predetermined in the cache, and both codegen and storage creation are depending on the cache files, consistency can be ensured.",

      "message": "The split up of the input processor is in the works now (we started it last quarter and expect to finish it this quarter). That\u0027s our intended fix for the crashes - given that we never got to the root cause last time, I\u0027m suspecting the crash perhaps just got less flaky (or is being hidden with build retries). In either scenario, I apologize and ask for more time for us to get this to prod and roll it out ðŸ˜Š",

      "message": "Now Android RBE calls clang-tidy.sh, added in aosp/2111024, to work around the stdout/stderr issue. It saves stdout and stderr into two temp files and merges the files after execution of clang-tidy or clang. Since that change we have not seen mixed stdout/stderr or crashes due to that. Is there other kind of RBE crash or capacity issue?",

      "message": "Could we please keep this KISS check as it offers us a simple and understandable error message.\n\nRationalization: KISS, This does catch a common issue in a makefile, when a variable housing the partition list is empty. getopt should be the one that recognizes the failure to find a argument, but it does not.\n\nThere is no list of valid partitions and their combinations (they are to be a comma separate list officially, but not), we should be able to make up any partitions here and they should work (future proofing if for nothing else). If I had a valid list of partition names I could parse it and validate it, but it would be far more complex (see line 173 to 216).\n\nThe test of valid partitions _could_ be added in 173-216, but its message would be confusing as compared to this error message ...\n\nwhile we were initially reviewing this, someone added odm partition as a valid. Tomorrow some vendor will want vendor and vendor-firmware, lets not cap them from doing so.\n\nIt does catch -D -F -P -h and -o (of course, with a space to any following parameter). Not being able to catch -ooutputfile is acceptable because who is to say we do not want to blacklist the ooutputfile directory?",

      "message": "Hi Colin, can we re-evaluate this given the discussion and Tom\u0027s opposition to doing this in the rc file in I20cc7a956c561517b340d8b69382de713dda74e3? It does seem like not including the cameraserver package in the first place would be the cleanest solution.\n\nPotentially we could do this with Makefile trickery further down the line, i.e.\n\n  PRODUCT_PACKAGES :\u003d $(filter-out cameraserver,$(PRODUCT_PACKAGES))\n\nbut violating the additive nature of this inheritance chain seems like it might cause headaches later on.\n\nDo you see other cleaner possibilities? Should cameraserver come in through base_system / should ATV be inheriting from base_system?",

      "message": "I\u0027ve spent some time restructuring this hierarchy lately. There are essentially 3 tiers now (there used to be 7 I think):\n- base: clockwork fork off here\n- core_minimal (media_x.mk files): car, tv, and some other internal projects\n- generic_no_telephony (handheld_x.mk files): phones, tablets\n\nIsn\u0027t it just phones and tablets that have cameras? maybe cars? I\u0027d argue cameraserver is at the wrong level at the moment, and should be moved down to one of these children (maybe handheld). If you do this, it\u0027d be worth reaching out to the impacted teams.\n\nI don\u0027t particularly like the concept of a child un-doing what one of its ancestors has done, though it\u0027s already rampant via other mechanisms (LOCAL_OVERRIDES_PACKAGES and friends).",

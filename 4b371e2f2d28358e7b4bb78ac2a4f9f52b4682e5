OTA servers should and could then use libvintf directly to check these files.\n\nAs far as a tag specifically for the odm manifest, I say, no way. It\u0027s already distinguished by location. Further identification makes it hard to move manifests, makes them more specialized, etc..., and I\u0027m already not a big fan of \u0027device\u0027 vs \u0027framework\u0027.",

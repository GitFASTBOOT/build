      "message": "This can happen for various reasons where further up in this file memtag_heap is filtered from the my_sanitize list. In my case it was this\n\n```\nifneq ($(filter arm x86 x86_64,$(TARGET_$(LOCAL_2ND_ARCH_VAR_PREFIX)ARCH)),)\n```\n\nI think it\u0027s easier to just fix it in one place than fix up all the places that don\u0027t properly exclude it, especially as the file is written in a way that the build will incorrectly just pass through the memtag_heap to clang if one is set but not the other.\n\nSoong doesn\u0027t have this bug.",

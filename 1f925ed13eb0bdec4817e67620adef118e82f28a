We have separate module types for the art primary image (bootclasspath_fragment) and the framework extension image (platform_bootclasspath) so ideally they should be being provided separately to each of them and the latter should include the former if necessary.",

Perhaps, but that\u0027s a different cup of tea.\n\n\u003e the latter should include the former if necessary\n\nWell, even if the framework boot image depends on the primary one, it doesn\u0027t need the ART boot image profile.

However, I think it should be split into two separate parts, one to specify what is needed for ART and one to specify what is needed for framework.\n\n\u003e It\u0027s an implementation detail.\n\nI thought it was but the way this is implemented (passing both together for use by both images) and previous comments about whether the ART profile needs to be part of the SDK implied that the framework image needed to know the ART profile.\n\nAs that does not appear to be true then it makes even more sense to split the variable into separate variables.\n\nDefinitely a separate change.",

      "message": "In AOSP, in increased the number of actions from 374033 to 390630.  It removes a lot of copy actions, but adds in some heavier real actions (for example, Soong checkbuild probably includes R8, which Make\u0027s checkbuild skips, and Soong\u0027s will include 32-bit libraries), so run time is probably increased.  I would be surprised if disk usage is decreased though since all the copies into out/target/product are removed.",

We still want to remove them from bcp and not allow apps target \u003e\u003dR to link to them, but we will track that separately from mainline work (and at a lower priority).

We ran into system health issues with the solution we implemented for removing telephony-common. We believe it will be resolved once hidden API cleanup is done, but if we run into further issues that may become a factor.\n2. Given the higher priority of mainline work for telephony, some work items that are not mandatory for mainline may be dropped.",

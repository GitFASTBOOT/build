      "message": "As we discussed offline, the reason to have them on bcp is that they have been on bcp in the past releases and as a result vendor/public apps use these libs. We still want to remove them from bcp and not allow apps target \u003e\u003dR to link to them, but we will track that separately from mainline work (and at a lower priority).

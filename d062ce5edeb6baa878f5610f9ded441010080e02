In this case it is fine, because soong_ui will always have created the file.\n\nOne option is to put an empty rule to generate the file like you suggested.  The other is to not depend on $(test_mapping_list), and instead do echo $(PRIVATE_test_mappings) \u003e $@.list and use that as the -l argument to soong_zip.",

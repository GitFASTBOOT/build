      "message": "intermediates-dir-for here breaks the layering between Soong and Make.  That layering is already a little confused due to dexpreopting the boot jars in Make, but I\u0027d like to not make it worse.  I\u0027d suggest copying the boot jars into $(PRODUCT_OUT)/dex_bootjars_input or something, and using that path here.  Then when I move dexpreopting the boot jars into Soong I can remove the extra copy.",

      "message": "\u003e Why don\u0027t we have target_files.zip for 16k OTA ? \n\n1. Building a target_files.zip takes a long time.\n2. To build a 16K target_files.zip, we would need to first obtain a regular target_files.zip, replace the boot image inside, and repack. Much of the work in this process is just unnecessary. Better to create OTA from a single boot_16k.img directly.\n\n\u003e This is helpful to generate package directly based on image files but I don\u0027t get how it fits with 16k OTA ?\n\n\nDuring build, we will create a boot_16k.img, which contains the 16K linux kernel. This tool would allow the build pipeline to start building a 16K OTA as soon as the boot image is ready, rather than having to wait until EVERYTHING finishes(target_files.zip gets built after everything else finishes building).",

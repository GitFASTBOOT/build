      "message": "My bad. This is indeed misleading (I was probably thinking about different approaches, with one of them having a side-effect of not generating super_empty.img).\n\nThis CL actually tries to address the issue with the retrofit full OTA package building (i.e. as part of `m dist`). It tries to keep allowing generating split super images, so that retrofit full OTA package building works.\n\nNow I think I can do this in a better way, to not generating them both (split super as well as retrofit full OTA), by computing a new make variable. I\u0027ll update this CL.",

Perhaps an example would help.\n\nWe effectively want two targets for each \"thing\":\n\nA library containing compiled org.bouncycastle code and a library containing compiled com.android.org.bouncycastle code.\n\ncom.android.org.bouncycastle is for use on device.\norg.bouncycastle can be used in the unbundled apps case, or for host.\n\nPreviously there were 2 targets:\n\nOne that sometimes produced org.bouncycastle and sometimes com.android.org.bouncycastle depending on whether it was a host or a device library depending on it.\n\nOne that always produces org.bouncycastle.\n\nAFAICT my change here switches a host module to using the always-org.bouncycastle version because after my proposed follow-up change we can no longer have a target that conditionally produces different packages (which I also think is rather confusing).",

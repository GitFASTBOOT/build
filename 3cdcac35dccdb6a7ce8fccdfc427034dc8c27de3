      "message": "My kernel dist directory is outside of my Android source directory, so I\u0027m symlinking it in so that I can build an Android image with a custom kernel. The target that I\u0027m building uses find-copy-subdir-files to find files in the kernel dist directory.\n\nIf you don\u0027t support symlinks pointing outside of the source tree, I think that would be very unfortunate, because I use them for various local development scenarios.",

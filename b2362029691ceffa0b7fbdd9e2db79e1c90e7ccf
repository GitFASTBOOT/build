      "message": "Yes, I think we are addressing the same problem.\nI wanted to list the missing modules by collecting the missing dependencies using `ALLOW_MISSING_DEPENDENCIES` command. So that it will not be that difficult to create the list.\n\nIn soong, a module have multiple variants that have different dependencies. Do you want to list the modules with the specific variants information to include in the api domain?",

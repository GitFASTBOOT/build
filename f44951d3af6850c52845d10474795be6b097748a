      "message": "btw Colin, here was the reasoning for mast@ why mainline targets as well:\n\n\u003e My understanding is that (b) is the problem here, and specifically the PAGE_SIZE macro needs to have the same setting in both module and test builds. So can we ensure that setting is the same in the module builds (typically TARGET_PRODUCT\u003dmodule_x86_64 from `banchan com.google.android.art x86_64` or TARGET_PRODUCT\u003dcf_x86_64_phone from `lunch cf_x86_64_phone-trunk_staging-userdebug`) and the test builds (typically TARGET_PRODUCT\u003daosp_x86_64 from `lunch aosp_x86_64-trunk_staging-userdebug`)?\n\u003e\n\u003e That\u0027s the preferred approach at least, before we consider different ways of making the tests tolerant to build differences.",

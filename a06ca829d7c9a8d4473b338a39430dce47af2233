That said, we probably aren\u0027t going to be doing one without the other, and now we are going to use ANDROID_DESKTOP_MIGRATION_IMAGE anyway.",

      "message": "I am wondering if we really need to introduce a separate `super_migration.img` image target. We can already build such an image with the `ANDROID_DESKTOP_MIGRATION_IMAGE\u003dtrue` option and have smaller `super.img` as a result, which could be used as input parameter to `pack_migration_image` I guess. That way we would not need these changes to Makefile. WDYT?",

We could build a smaller super.img by using ANDROID_DESKTOP_MIGRATION_IMAGE\u003dtrue, as you mention, but then the other images would also have a smaller super.img. If we are fine with that, then I agree we don\u0027t need this part.",

      "message": "I am wondering if we really need to introduce a separate `super_migration.img` image target. We can already build such an image with the `ANDROID_DESKTOP_MIGRATION_IMAGE\u003dtrue` option and have smaller `super.img` as a result, which could be used as input parameter to `pack_migration_image` I guess. That way we would not need these changes to Makefile. WDYT?",

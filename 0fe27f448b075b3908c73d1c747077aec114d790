      "message": "There\u0027s a pending CL that is trying to do that (go/aog/2710215), but from comments it looks like it might have issues.\n\nRegardless, the eventual end game (from comms I\u0027ve seen) is that lunch targets lacking a release type will not be allowed, and lunch will break on them.  So we\u0027ll need a CL like this eventually.\n\nIndeed, I claim that the current state is actively harmful, because if someone chooses one of these lunch targets as they currently are, they will get a \"fourth build type\" which is none of target_staging, trunk_food, nor next.  And it may very well break in subtle and time-wasting ways.  So I think we should land this sooner rather than later.",

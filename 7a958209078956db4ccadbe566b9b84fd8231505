      "message": "PTAL\n\nThe shell script caused breakage under mac_os, which uses an earlier version of bash that does not support associative arrays.\n\nThis commit is identical to the original; except, the shell script has been changed to /bin/sh syntax to maximize portability.\n\nI tested the script by pointing /bin/sh to bash4, bash3 and to dash. It was necessary to work around another bug in bash3 by moving a case statement outside a $() substitution.\n\nIs there a way to run the specific mac_os build that failed presubmit instead of waiting to see if it works post-submit?\n",

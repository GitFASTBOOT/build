      "message": "I was worried that go/aog/2806253 has some issues that might delay it getting submitted (like not allowing a bare \"get_build_var\" invocation to work anymore).\n\nIn the meantime, I wanted to put the tree into a state where we at least don\u0027t allow invalid build setups.  Which I still think is a much better state than silently doing into an invalid build setup.\n\nI\u0027ll roll this back into go/aog/2806253, and hopefully there\u0027s less concern there than I thought (jham@ seems good with it), so we can stop allowing invalid build setups.",

      "message": "Hi Jiyong,\n\nThe library libdmabufheap is going to be needed to build the shared library libcodec2_vndk(https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/av/+/master/media/codec2/vndk/Android.bp#16) Here is the bug number b/168333162.\nIn order to get it to build, we were following the example of libion(also marked VNDK-SP) which this library is supposed to deprecate/replace eventually. Would marking the library as double_loadable:true be more appropriate? Thank you!\n\nRegards,\nHridya",

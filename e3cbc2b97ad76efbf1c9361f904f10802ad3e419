      "message": "I disagree.  This may lead to someone to fix the prebuilts that they don\u0027t own.  Please take multiple-gerrit and/or multiple-ownership into consideration.\n\nSome downstream vendors may suffer from always-check-by-default.  It was the reason why I added a separate \"check-elf-files\" that checks all visible modules instead of checking them by default.\n\nIMO, the correct direction is to cleanup internal tree and add check-elf-files to make goal into the targets with checkbuild.  I somehow regret that I did not add one ASAP 6 months ago when I cleared all of them once.",

      "message": "Hmmm. Maybe I should add something like \"BUILD_BROKEN_PREBUILT_SONAME_MISMATCH\" or similar for specific devices? I do feel strongly about getting these checks on by default at least (or at least for new devices) because I need to have the build system understand these prebuilts in order to add certain other types of checks.\n\nLet me setup a sync to talk about this in more detail. It\u0027s clear your input is needed on this.",

Please take multiple-gerrit and/or multiple-ownership into consideration.\n\nSome downstream vendors may suffer from always-check-by-default.  It was the reason why I added a separate \"check-elf-files\" that checks all visible modules instead of checking them by default.\n\nIMO, the correct direction is to cleanup internal tree and add check-elf-files to make goal into the targets with checkbuild.  I somehow regret that I did not add one ASAP 6 months ago when I cleared all of them once.",

Looks like BoardUsesRecoveryAsBoot doesn\u0027t necessarily mean \"dedicated recovery partition\", so, to avoid confusion, I\u0027ve changed the terms to \"BoardUsesRecoveryAsBoot\" . \n\n\u003e If RecoveryAsBoot is active, then non-recovery ramdisk binaries are installed to $OUT/recovery/root/first_stage_ramdisk and recovery ramdisk binaries are installed to $OUT/recovery, which I think is the case you are trying to tackle?\n\n\nCorrect",

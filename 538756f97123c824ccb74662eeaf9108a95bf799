      "message": "It is the easiest way to add integration test in Soong to make sure the unused code path does not bitrot: such tests need to affect Soong behavior by setting various \"real-world\" configurations, as the normal build would do. A unit test does not require a global configuration, but it would not test much either (not the real dexpreopt command, just the trivial java.bcpForDexpreopt() function).\n\nThis is easy to remove, so I wouldn\u0027t worry about it.",

      "message": "No, unfortunately all user builds have to be release-key signed because we have to run CTS tests on ChromeOS test images (which cannot be release-key signed) on android user images. We cannot run CTS tests on ChromeOS release builds because certain tooling required to test the ARC build (e.g., adb, etc) is only available on ChromeOS test builds. I looked into running a separate signing step over only the Android image during the ChromeOS test build, but since we would not be signing with actual release keys (because it is not technically a release build) and it wouldn\u0027t make sense to create a new set of dev-keys for this specific case, we would effectively be adding significant overhead to each test build in order to do essentially a no-op (aka re-signing the Android build with the same dev keys) and change the tag from \"dev-keys\" to \"release-keys\".\n\nI know this doesn\u0027t seem like the best system, but for ARC builds it is helpful to think about ro.build.tags as not the keys that the whole image is signed, but the keys with which the GMS APK is signed. Since we always use signed a GMS APK Prebuilt in ARC user images, setting the tags to release-key here will always be consistent.",

      "message": "Metalava has a lot of support for finding super methods, maybe you could use that. e.g. if the method is not found then you could search for its `MethodItem.superMethods()`. I am concerned that you are essentially rewriting lots of Metalava code.",

      "message": "At this point, the code doesn\u0027t have access to the MethodItem anymore, and I don\u0027t want to keep a reference to it when parsing the API signature file because that will make the parsed data different depending on if the input is an API signature file or api-versions.xml.\n\nMaybe the entire tool should be redesigned to use metalava more heavily. Something to consider down the line?",

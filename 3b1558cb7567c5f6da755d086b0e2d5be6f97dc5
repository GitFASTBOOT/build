      "message": "Changing this is not sufficient, as downstream users of my_prebuilt_src_file expect it to be a single file.  For example, cc_prebuilt_internal.mk uses it as a dependency to a rule that calls transform-prebuilt-to-target, which calls copy-file-to-target, which copies $\u003c to $@.  $\u003c is the first prerequisite, so any additional LOCAL_SRC_FILES past the first will be ignored.\n\nMaybe a better change would be checking if there is more than one word in LOCAL_SRC_FILES, and if so print an error suggesting BUILD_MULTI_PREBUILT instead of BUILD_PREBUILT.",

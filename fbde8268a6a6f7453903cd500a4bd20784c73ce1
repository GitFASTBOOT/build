      "message": "tomrenn@ - I think Dan means that instead of adding new files to https://android.googlesource.com/platform/build/+/refs/heads/emu-master-dev, we should use a smaller-scope git project (https://android.googlesource.com/platform/build/bazel).\n\nCurrently there\u0027s no emu-master-dev branch for /build/bazel. So that would require aa new branch - which does seem cleaner, though.\n\nAlso, since we\u0027re requesting a new branch, I\u0027d just request them for /prebuilts/bazel/\u003cplatform\u003e as well to hold bazel binaries - so we no longer need to map in /prebuilts/tools:studio-main and things are more isolated - WDYT?",

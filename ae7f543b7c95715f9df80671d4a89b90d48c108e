      "message": "This is the same as the reverted aosp/2450642, right?\n\nThen I expect it to fail in the same way: b/270958097. I have not been trying to investigate and fix that error as I am working on a different approach: to enable dex2oat and dexpreopt but use compiler filter \"verify\" (essentially not compiling anything, generating .oat files with only a header but no compiled code). \n\nPrashanth Swaminathan disabled dexpreopt for the slim manifest temporarily to unblock further progress, but he\u0027s also using unconventional ART settings (no default ART config, a custom patch to disable JIT) that should be reverted later. He was also looking at the b/270958097 but AFAIK without any conclusion.\n\nI don\u0027t mind relanding aosp/2450642 or this patch if b/270958097 is fixed, but I will revert it later when my proper fix is ready.",

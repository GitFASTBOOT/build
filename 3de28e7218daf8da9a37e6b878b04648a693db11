As far as I can tell, this would only happen for two modules with different $(my_register_name) but same install path, but if that happened wouldn\u0027t it already be an error for duplicate installation rules?",

My LSC exposes those cases by making every module basically have an associated notice file.\n\nThey do exist. They are blocking several of the LSC changes. And they are blocking me from fixing the merged-in issues I inadvertently created.",

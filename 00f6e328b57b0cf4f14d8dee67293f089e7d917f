Once make has processed all the build files, this is built really fast.\n\nCTS/TH team plans to use it with the OWNERS.zip so it would make more sense that they\u0027re distributed together.\n\nOtherwise I think you\u0027re saying I need to update the busytown configs to all build it?",

At some point we\u0027re going to need to take a look at this.\n\nIn this particular case, we don\u0027t build CTS with a full platform, so owners.zip will show up on nearly every build *except* a CTS(test_suites) build (unless the busytown config is updated to add \u0027module-info\u0027/\u0027owners\u0027 to the command line of test_suites). Maybe this should be using the \u0027tests\u0027 or \u0027cts\u0027 goals? That would distribute it with the builds that are building/distributing tests or cts.",

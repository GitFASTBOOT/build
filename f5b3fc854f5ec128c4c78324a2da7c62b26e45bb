That I could verify by looking at logcat. Can\u0027t think of any good way to turn that into a repeatable test without intercepting the violation reporting somehow and having \"adb dumpsys runtime\" include something like \"no reporting\", \"reporting\" and \"blocked\" depending on whether the reflection call was logged or rejected.",

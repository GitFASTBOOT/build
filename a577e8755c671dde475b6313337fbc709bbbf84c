      "message": "Following up on the discussion from last year.  Here\u0027s a prototype of a new lunch command. It doesn\u0027t quite follow the doc, but I think it\u0027s clean.\n\nI think what we should do is try this out for a little while, and if people like it then delete the old lunch command.\n\nFeatures:\n- The curated menu is gone\n- New --list-... parameters as a shortcut for get_build_var all_named_products, etc.\n\nDifferences from the doc:\n- It requires a TARGET_PRODUCT. Doesn\u0027t try to default to aosp_arm.\n- Still supports the old product-release-variant format. The more I think about this I don\u0027t want to go update every script on the planet that uses the old format.\n\nNot done yet:\n- --list-releases\n- tab completion (I never use this because it takes too long to populate the list)",

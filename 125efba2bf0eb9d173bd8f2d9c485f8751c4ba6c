      "message": "I feel like these particular version numbers only really make sense for the kernel. Vendor boot will contain a small number of vendor kernel modules to be loaded during first stage init. It might be useful to have a version field that vendors can use in the vendor boot header as they wish. None exists currently and I don\u0027t know that we should change it for R, but perhaps we could add it in a later version.\n\nThen again, I\u0027m not even sure whether the os_version/os_patch_level are actually used in the boot header nowadays?",

(and they might be diverge after a system-only OTA).\n\nBefore Treble, all partitions are updated together so we just need one instance for each.\n\nSo this depends on how those info is used before Treble.\nIt just now we provide per-partition level info for them.\n\ne.g., I knew that os_version is used for keymaster version binding.",

      "message": "I feel like these particular version numbers only really make sense for the kernel. Vendor boot will contain a small number of vendor kernel modules to be loaded during first stage init. It might be useful to have a version field that vendors can use in the vendor boot header as they wish. None exists currently and I don\u0027t know that we should change it for R, but perhaps we could add it in a later version.\n\nThen again, I\u0027m not even sure whether the os_version/os_patch_level are actually used in the boot header nowadays?",

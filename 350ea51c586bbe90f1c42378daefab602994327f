      "message": "I tried putting this code in `build/make/target/product/runtime_libart.mk` but it didn\u0027t work because the code depends on PRODUCT_SHIPPING_API_LEVEL which is not resolved there.\n\nMeanwhile, this code is highly related to dexpreopting. The motivation to make the build system GC-type aware is that we can save some space by not emitting read barrier when we dexpreopt if we know that the device is going to use userfaultfd GC.\n\nIf you know a better place to put this code, please let me know.",

      "message": "My only problem with this change is that we aren\u0027t regenerating out/soong/.soong.bootstrap for any affected users, since we only run this target if out/soong/soong doesn\u0027t exist, which it will.\n\nCleanSpec.mk won\u0027t help, since we don\u0027t get that far.\n\nI could change this rule to make $(SOONG_OUT_DIR)/.soong.bootstrap depend on bootstrap.bash, so that anytime bootstrap.bash is updated, then we re-run bootstrap, but that\u0027s not strictly necessary. And ideally, we\u0027d want to re-run it any time SOONG_OUT_DIR changes.",

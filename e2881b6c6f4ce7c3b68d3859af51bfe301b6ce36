      "message": "I think it\u0027d be more reasonable to provide an opt-in flag for forbidding multiple ancestors from defining the same single-value variable. Toggling between two different orders just seems like way more customization than what\u0027s reasonable.\n\nI also don\u0027t think your proposed ordering is necessarily better than the other: how does someone changing the product config X know how it\u0027s going to affect all the products that inherit X?\n\nAnswer: they have no clue, without looking at all of them.\n\nThis change would allow more flexibility as you\u0027re not relying on the makefile names, but it seems to be working around a more fundamental problem which should be solved by editing the makefiles defining these values.\n\nAlternatively, overriding the single-value-variable value in the child?",

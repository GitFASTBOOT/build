It seems to me it should be named differently (like INTERNAL_SUPERIMAGE_TARGET), which will be dist\u0027d at L4446.\n\nThen INSTALLED_SUPERIMAGE_TARGET should always point to the one at $(PRODUCT_OUT), to replace the INSTALLED_SUPERIMAGE_DEV_TARGET in this CL. The phony target of superimage should also point to this file, which won\u0027t be built with `make` (unless having BOARD_BUILD_SUPER_IMAGE_BY_DEFAULT).",

      "message": "I would still prefer having `superimage` pointing to $(PRODUCT_OUT)/super.img even for real devices. The images built with `superimage`, `systemimage`, `vbmetaimage` should be consistent with each other.\n\nOtherwise with PS9, the built `superimage` would be only useful when building/using along with `updatepackage` (for devices w/ verity on). And it seems hard for developers to get it right.  For real devices, we can even remove the phony shortcut to this dist version?",

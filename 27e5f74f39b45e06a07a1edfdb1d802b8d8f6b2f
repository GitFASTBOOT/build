It seems to me it should be named differently (like INTERNAL_SUPERIMAGE_TARGET), which will be dist\u0027d at L4446.\n\nThen INSTALLED_SUPERIMAGE_TARGET should always point to the one at $(PRODUCT_OUT), to replace the INSTALLED_SUPERIMAGE_DEV_TARGET in this CL. The phony target of superimage should also point to this file, which won\u0027t be built with `make` (unless having BOARD_BUILD_SUPER_IMAGE_BY_DEFAULT).",

      "message": "\u003e are there potential problems here when GSI replaces an OEM\u0027s /system since GSI isn\u0027t setting the props anymore?\n\nI expect it should be okay by 2 reasons:\n\n1. aosp_$arch has vendor partition because of emulator, so these system property are not in GSI on aosp_$arch from P. The patch fix the targets aosp_$arch_ab and gsi_$arch to sync with aosp_$arch.\n\n2. The number of these system properties is less than 10 (That\u0027s why we did not realize the problem before). I had reviewed them one-by-one. For the properties should be in the GSI, I move them to product partition (/system/product/build.prop).\n\nBTW, we found the problem is because ro.apex.updatable\u003dtrue, it should be in vendor but it is in GSI (aosp_$arch_ab) without the patch. And we need the patch for Q beta.",

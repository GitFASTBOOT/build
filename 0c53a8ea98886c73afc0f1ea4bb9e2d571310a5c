      "message": "If there is a bug then it has to be fixed.\n\nI don\u0027t believe I understand the impact of this change:\n1. does it affect \"final SDK\"?\n2. does anyone build with the NDK?\n\nThus I am strongly against moving things around at this stage.\nThe whole purpose of CI was to have a working reproducible pipeline, which we can confidently use for all releases. This goes against it.\nAlso, one of the biggest reasons why SDK finalization process took so long last time - was because of such \"last second\" changes. I don\u0027t want to create precedent.\n\n@bkhalife@google.com please check what was done last year, and if the impact was big enough to guarantee the process change.",

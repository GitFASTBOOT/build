It looks there are some commits after our last update, not sure they are helpful for rbc.",

The main point of this cl is to add `--mode\u003dmake`.\n\nInteresting, I haven\u0027t really looked at the latest updates to starlark-go. But I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any pressing need to update it, we have all the features we need at the moment.",

I spent 15-20 minutes hunting down an issue that turned out to be a stale tblgen binary in out/host/linux-x86/bin/tblgen (built sometime in January).",

FORCE_BUILD_LLVM_COMPONENTS: this will build the self-hosted clang/LLVM using prebuilts/clang and place the output in out/host.\n2. USE_BUILT_LLVM_COMPONENTS: don\u0027t rebuild LLVM/clang, but use whatever clang is present in out/host.\n\ndefinitely open to other suggestions.",

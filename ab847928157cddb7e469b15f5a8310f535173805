The details are available in the git commit message findable with git blame if necessary.\n\nSo, I asked this question in your other change, but do you plan to address the issues and remove these lines in the near future? If so, I think they\u0027re totally okay without any more detailed comments. If not, a simple comment, like a reference to the offending change, goes a long way toward improving the readability of the code, IMHO.",

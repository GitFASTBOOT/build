There\u0027s not much difference between a struct with a set of exported methods and a struct that implements an interface that lists the same set of methods, except that the interface requires duplicated definitions of each method signature.",

These interfaces define compliance\u0027s contract with the outside world.\n\nI have no objection to another organization implementing these interfaces to reflect a different policy, and I strongly doubt anyone else has an objection. I have no objection to implementing test versions of these interfaces.\n\nThe principal restriction is one cannot expect to mix and match implementations or even data from different graphs with the same implementation. Compliance at Google will generally treat it as an error if someone tries to use another organization\u0027s implementation or a test implementation as if it were ours.",

      "message": "\"Contract with the outside world\" in Go is handled with exported vs. unexported identifiers (https://go.dev/ref/spec#Exported_identifiers).  Interfaces are better used for polymorphism.\n\nUsing the structs directly (deleting the LicenseCondition interface and renaming licenseConditionImp to LicenseCondition) will provide the exact same public interface and immutability protections via Go\u0027s package access rules.  It also removes a third of the files in your CLs and a layer of indirection that makes understanding the code and navigating it with an IDE harder.\n\nIf you don\u0027t have a concrete plan for multiple implementations of an interface I\u0027d suggest removing it.

      "message": "Hi Joe, thanks for your quick review. The new xml file is defined in aosp/3211631 which is designed for OEMs to customize some UIDs. I guess technically we don\u0027t need it here as that file is currently empty, but I am not sure if we should document it somewhere to indicate that the product config files need to be changed. I am not sure what\u0027s the common practice?",

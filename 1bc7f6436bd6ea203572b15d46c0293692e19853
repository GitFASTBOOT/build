If I\u0027m reading it right it\u0027s\n- creating the $(LOCAL_MODULE).txt PHONY -- I would assume this is unused, do you know of a good way to sruvey?\n\n- making $(LOCAL_MODULE) depend on the main stubs txt (not the stubs txt for the droiddoc being built). Doesn\u0027t really make sense, I think?",

      "message": "Yeah, I figured this was a small amount of work that would make any future testing (to either improve or remove USAPs) easier.  Plus, our partners currently have to apply a source patch to AOSP if they want to enable USAPs so this should make things easier for them.\n\nI haven\u0027t had a chance to finish testing on this but I should be able to wrap it up next week.",

      "message": "Like I mentioned in that other change, I\u0027d expect for this to push these find commands out of the find emulator (https://github.com/google/kati/blob/master/src/find.cc). Unless they were already not ending up there, which is a bug, though maybe not a high priority one.\n\nAn alternative would either be forcing sorts in the find emulator (we do this for wildcards and findleaves, but not normal commands IIRC), or teaching the find emulator about one or both of these patterns. Either one of those would likely help other cases in vendor code too.",

      "message": "So my understanding is:\n1. These find commands should end up in the find-emulator. If they aren\u0027t using the find emulator but rather using /usr/bin/find, that\u0027s a bug we have to fix separately.\n2. If the find emulator is being used, but the outputs are not in sorted order, we can fix the emulator to return sorted results for these find patterns.\n\nApart from these two points, what is the purpose of the already existing sort command in `$(sort $(shell ...))` ? it seems like that `sort` doesn\u0027t help us today anyway since kati seems to be invalidating when the inner `$(shell ...)` results change.\n\nAnd separately - wouldn\u0027t it be more readable to put the `sort` command in the command line to make it explicit that the results are being sorted?",

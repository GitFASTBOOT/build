      "message": "hello, we may have new feature/arch in future. So I\u0027m sure whether it can reduce the effort. Maybe we can try it another way, that is to inherit the basic features from older arch and add new features below. What do you think?",

      "message": "Ideally these would be exported from Soong, but I never got around to it.\n\nIt\u0027s unlikely to actually cause issues in practice, but in Soong these are all per-bitness (x86 vs x86_64), while here there\u0027s one value that\u0027s hopefully the same across both. That can cause issues in stranger situations -- like if we\u0027re building unbundled apps and have different expected minimum capabilities between the architectures.",

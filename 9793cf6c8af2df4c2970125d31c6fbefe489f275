I can have this just include aosp_arm64.mk if that is preferable. I was just trying to separate the two targets as much as possible so further changes in one will not affect the other.",

Presumably the intent is that changes in aosp_arm64 *should* be getting the changes in aosp_arm64 to avoid it getting stale, and that\u0027s why it\u0027s set up to inherit it currently\n\nUnless there\u0027s specifically things in aosp_arm64 that you don\u0027t want here and can\u0027t override, it seems like a good idea to keep it as-is (the ifeq seems harmless).",

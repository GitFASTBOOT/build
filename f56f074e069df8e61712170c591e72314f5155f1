      "message": "AFAIU framework-atb-backward-compatibility was only part of ATB (the necessary minimum). Now we have that part in framework-minus-apex. But presumably that is not the same as having full ATB in bootclasspath. So, we no longer want to support a configuration with full ATB in bootclasspath? Can you expand the commit message to explain why that configuration is no longer needed?",

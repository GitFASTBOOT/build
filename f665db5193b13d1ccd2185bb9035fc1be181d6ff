      "message": "Thanks Inseob for pointing out this gap in my implementation. I was testing my change with `aosp_cf_x86_64_phone`, and it turns out that `android_info.prop` is empty for this product.\n\nI think I agree with Cole\u0027s idea in this [CL thread](https://android-review.git.corp.google.com/c/platform/build/soong/+/3081436/comment/3963cb2e_3a7ad278/). Eventually it would be nice to have discrete `android_info` soong modules per board config radio combination, instead of having a singleton that manages all combinations. The former is more aligned with the incremental soong design.\n\nThis also means that we vendor-build.prop is not ready to be migrated to soong yet.\n\nTo reconcile the missing build.prop file in the autogenerated soong vendor.img file, I would like to autogenerate a `build_prop` module for the current product. The Android.bp defs of these will eventually be checked-in (after some deduping).\n\nI have updated the scope of the CL to export the board config variables necessary to support this autogeneration.",

      "message": "Globbing gsi_* could also include non-phone-GSI products in downstream branches, which contains god-knows-what product names.\n\nI think the problem with the current check is that people could get a build break whether this is set intentionally or not.\n\nThe main take of this change is, whether intentionally or not, setting this shouldn\u0027t be a breakage, as long as the image is not release signed. (in fact this  already is a redundant check, because for \nPRODUCT_INSTALL_DEBUG_POLICY_TO_SYSTEM_EXT to work, the device need to be unlocked or AVB disabled anyway, because vendor_boot-debug mustn\u0027t be signed)\n\n------\n\nIf they could be using their own signing tool, them there\u0027s no point for us implementing this check, because they can just remove this line in their local tree",

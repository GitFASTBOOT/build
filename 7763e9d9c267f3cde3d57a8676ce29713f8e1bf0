      "message": "Is the limit on shard count due to a limit on the mathematics implementation or is it based on the sharding itself?\n\nIt seems to me that it\u0027d be nice to rename int_check_valid and/or _math_check_valid to clarify their differences, or to possibly refactor the checks such that there only needs to be one check (probably int_check_valid) and the math routines call it automatically whenever they make a new number (unless doing that would be super slow).",

      "message": "Is there an advantage in putting the build process of the resource files into a shard as opposed to putting it in a separate named rule?\n\nIt seems to me that it\u0027d be easier to recognize what\u0027s going on if the resources were part of their own named rule and the final zipping rule (line 497) were to depend on the java shards and also the resource jar (which would also make it easier to refactor how the resources jar gets built if that process ever becomes different from building the java code)",

      "message": "The reason I picked EXPERIMENTAL_USE_OPENJDK9 is because that\u0027s an environment variable that already exists (I see you\u0027ve now noticed that), and because I don\u0027t know about another reasonable use case.\n\nDo you have another use case (a good reason to use a custom toolchain)? The bundled toolchain is specifically so we can guarantee that the toolchain exhibits exactly the expected/supported behavior (e.g. has appropriate set of bug fixes / bugs :).",

      "message": "\"super_vendor.img\" should be serving the retrofit OTA generation only? That is, the availability of that image should be a result of this BOARD_BUILD_RETROFIT_DYNAMIC_PARTITIONS_OTA_PACKAGE flag.\n\n\u003e Technically, you can have a setup with a physical vendor partition (that\u0027s part of super block devices) but no logical vendor partition; for example, we could technically remove the logical vendor partition from a retrofit device.\n\nHmm that sounds like effectively PS5 of this CL? PS5 would still generate a retrofit full OTA, with vendor setup as one of super block devices, but without the image for vendor partition. Since such a package won\u0027t be useful in practice, not generating that nor the super_*.img seems like a cleaner option.",

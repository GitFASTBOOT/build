What we\u0027d really want is copy-on-write, but that has very very limited support (it requires filesystem support, and the default filesystems we all use do not support it)\n\nhttps://android-review.git.corp.google.com/c/platform/build/soong/+/2516697 is adding hardlinks for certain packaging tasks, but only ones that are not exposed in the ninja graph. That has more discussion around the dangers here too.",

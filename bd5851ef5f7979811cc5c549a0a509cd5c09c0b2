      "message": "note that this is broken too. i think this should be \nadb shell readlink /proc/$PID/exe\" instead, to get the absolute path to the executable. i\u0027m a bit confused about how this can be working for you. this should get you \"crasher\", and OUT_EXE_SYMBOLS should be .../symbols, so where is the missing \"/system/xbin/\" coming from?",

      "message": "again, if you fix the name of the variable, it\u0027s more obvious that this is wrong. there are no executables in the symbols directory. so the example gdbclient commands on go/dalvik don\u0027t work after this change. they used to work \"by accident\" because most stuff is actually in /system/bin. but now you need to know what executable you\u0027re actually trying to run.\n\nsince a pid is mandatory to actually connect, i think this function needs to use readlink, and then it can just pass the absolute path (on the _device_ file system) to any functions that need an executable.",

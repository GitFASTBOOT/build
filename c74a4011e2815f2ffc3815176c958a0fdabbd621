      "message": "Thanks for raising this. I\u0027m only adding a Make variable that corresponds to an existing Soong variable (`DISABLE_PREOPT_BOOT_IMAGES` -\u003e `DisablePreoptBootImages`). As long as those variables already exist in Soong, they can work with each other. I admit the variables are a bit messy, but we can clean them up later. Right now the first priority is to get b/280440941 resolved because ZBB-P1 is in a few days.",

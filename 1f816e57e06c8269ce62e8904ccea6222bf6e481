I subscribe to all the changes in this repo to stay in the loop about what\u0027s going on\n\n\u003e Do you know if this is all of them?\n\nIt\u0027s not - there are more sdk_* products in the internal tree. But like I said on the bug: it\u0027s possible that none of those build the \"sdk\" goal, so this CL may be fine as-is. In general it\u0027s not possible to know how all of these products we have are used, but it isn\u0027t reasonable to keep supporting every conceivable current use-case either.",

      "message": "I\u0027m not super experienced in python subprocesses and from what i researched this seems to be like an ok way to print subprocess output in real time. If i get a SIGINT then i propagate it to the called subprocess and exit. The output of the process after it\u0027s interrupted isn\u0027t captured but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s an issue since its output up until it was interrupted was logged and we log the interruption as well, so there shouldn\u0027t be any confusion.",

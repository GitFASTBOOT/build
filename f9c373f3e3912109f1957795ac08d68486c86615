Can this go into build/core/combo somewhere?\n\nCan those define STRIPPER and STRIPPER_COMMAND, where STRIPPER is the binary (the same as SOSLIM) for dependency purposes, and STRIPPER_COMMAND is the commandline that\u0027s run?  Alternatively, could we write a script that converts the arguments for the alternate strippers?\n\nWhat is this for anyway?",

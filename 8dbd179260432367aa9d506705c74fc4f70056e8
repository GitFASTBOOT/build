      "message": "1. I regard lunch as a way to set up the build environment for local use. In this case it\u0027s for building a module to be adb install\u0027ed. Why shouldn\u0027t that work?\n\n2. Irrespective of lunch\u0027ing, it makes no sense that module_* products build flattened APEXes. We could also set TARGET_FLATTEN_APEX:\u003dfalse here rather than including updatable_apex.mk, but I figured it\u0027d be good to have one place for it, and that the other stuff in there doesn\u0027t matter for the APEXes.",

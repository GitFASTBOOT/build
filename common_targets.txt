Recall that an Android build can be invoked via:
  make [<options>] [<targets>] [<variable>=<value>...]

Common Android build targets include:
  Generic targets:
    clean                   (aka clobber) equivalent to rm -rf out/
    checkbuild              Build every module defined in the source tree
    droid                   Default target
    nothing                 Do not build anything, just parse and validate the
                            build structure

    java                    Build all the java code in the source tree
    native                  Build all the native code in the source tree

    host                    Build all the host code (not to be run on a
                            device) in the source tree
    target                  Build all the target code (to be run on a device)
                            in the source tree

    (java|native)-(host|target)
    (host|target)-(java|native)
                            Build the intersection of the two given arguments

    snod                    Quickly rebuild the system image from built
                            packages. Stands for "System, NO Dependencies"
    vnod                    Quickly rebuild the vendor image from built
                            packages. Stands for "Vendor, NO Dependencies"

    doc-comment-check-docs  Check HTML doc links & validity, without
                            generating HTML.

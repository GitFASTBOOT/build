      "message": "Yea, this was called out in the bug.  However it was suggested that redundantly adding it to META would be better for us.  The only things the AB updater is dependent on is the META and IMAGES folders of the zip, so in the future we may remove the SYSTEM folder in zip packages that we want developers uploading to the server to reduce storage and bandwidth.  We\u0027d also like to go with the convention that any fields the server may need for processing the zip package would be in the META folder.",

We still need files under /SYSTEM or /BOOT when signing apks with release-keys.\n\nI don\u0027t know how the server processes the TF file. It feels like we probably don\u0027t need individual files for each property? Shall we make them (or even the ab_partitions above) into one meta file? (It\u0027s fine to get another file other than META/misc_info.txt, because Brillo can then kill this misc_info.txt when removing SYSTEM folders.)",

If we do come back to that, we\u0027ll keep the signing and release-keys in mind and discuss it properly before taking any action.  At least for now, though, adding the value to misc_info.txt can allow our server to unify the metadata lookup to only the META folder.",

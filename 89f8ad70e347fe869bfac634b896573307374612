      "message": "I\u0027m not sure why the NDK unwinding is handled in cxx_stl_setup.mk, so I\u0027ll add pcc just in case. That code was added in https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/build/+/1186095. At that time, both the platform and NDK modules needed to link an unwinder statically. Since then, the platform modules get the unwinder from libc.so instead.\n\ncxx_stl_setup.mk is also included in cc_prebuilt_internal.mk, but that makefile doesn\u0027t appear to use cxx_stl_setup.mk solely for my_shared_libraries, not my_static_libraries or my_ldflags.\n",

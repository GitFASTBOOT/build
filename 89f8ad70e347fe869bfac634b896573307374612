      "message": "I\u0027m not sure why the NDK unwinding is handled in cxx_stl_setup.mk, so I\u0027ll add pcc just in case. That code was added in https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/build/+/1186095. At that time, both the platform and NDK modules needed to link an unwinder statically. Since then, the platform modules get the unwinder from libc.so instead.\n\ncxx_stl_setup.mk is also included in cc_prebuilt_internal.mk, but that makefile doesn\u0027t appear to use cxx_stl_setup.mk solely for my_shared_libraries, not my_static_libraries or my_ldflags.\n",

      "message": "Since this is so hard to test in the platform, maybe it should land in the NDK first? OTOH, maybe part of the reason that it\u0027s hard to test is that the behavior is barely used so nbd.\n\nI think we build the gtest tests against the NDK, and iirc those make some use of exception handling. Run those to smoke test it?\n\nIs there any reason to worry about this interacting badly with the prebuilt r21 libc++/libc++abi in prebuilts/ndk? If no changes were needed on the libc++abi or libc++ side then probably not? The prebuilt libc++_shared.so will have linked libgcc for most architectures though, so if that wasn\u0027t done with hidden visibility maybe that\u0027s a concern.",

I don\u0027t think we can change that.\n\nIt doesn\u0027t make sense for the rest of the build to depend on the output from custom_images, since only some (or maybe none) of them will actually be installed on the device.\n\nIf you want another default (but optional) partition, it should be added in parallel with the current system/vendor/etc support (and/or that should be refactored into something that looks closer to what custom_images is).",

      "message": "I see, thanks for the feedback.\n\nHow about:\nAdd two more default (but optional) partition: oem and odm.\nThen it makes sense to include them during `make` and include their metadata into vbemta.img. This is also easier for OTA support (b/63974895)\n\nFor custom_images, their keys or metadata shouldn\u0027t be included in vbmeta.img. Because it might have multiple odm images: odm1.img, odm2.img, odm3.img, etc and only one of them will be included in a device (same mount point /odm). So the inclusion of custom images vbmeta should be an offline/separate process. \n  odm1.img should have a corresponding vbmeta1.img.\n  so on and so forth.",

I was hoping we could support them better by doing something like $(firstword) on them, rather than interpreting them as lists.\n\nIs this flag being here causing any immediate problems? If not, could you do something like this instead:\n_product_single_value_var_list +\u003d PRODUCT_COMPATIBLE_PROPERTY_OVERRIDE\n\nand at the end:\n_product_var-list +\u003d $(_product_single_value_var_list)",

      "message": "the old behavior of \"adbs logcat\" is that it\u0027s exactly like \"adb logcat\" except that it decodes stack traces. the new version loses all the non-stack lines. how can we fix that?",

      "message": "The two ideas I\u0027m thinking are either to return some value from the ProcessLine function to say that the line was not a recognized bit of output (like maybe return true when it finds a line it recognizes and false otherwise, and then print \"line\" on false), or to have ProcessLine print unrecognized lines.  The former seems preferable since the latter could add a lot of output where it isn\u0027t wanted.",

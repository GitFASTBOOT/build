Some of the existing ones may be runnable with com.android.tradefed.testtype.HostTest or the device equivalent, but my guess is most won\u0027t.\n\nI can make Soong java_test modules set LOCAL_COMPATIBILITY_SUTE :\u003d null-suite, and produce an autogenerated AndroidTest.xml.  If they don\u0027t specify a test runner I\u0027ll default to whatever Julien tells me to, and I can add a property to java_test to be able to set the test class explicitly if necessary.",

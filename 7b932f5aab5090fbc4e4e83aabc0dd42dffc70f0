      "message": "I wasn\u0027t sure whether we should do this or just do it in Soong.  Make doesn\u0027t know much about java tests - they are just java libraries with the tests tag.  Some of the existing ones may be runnable with com.android.tradefed.testtype.HostTest or the device equivalent, but my guess is most won\u0027t.\n\nI can make Soong java_test modules set LOCAL_COMPATIBILITY_SUTE :\u003d null-suite, and produce an autogenerated AndroidTest.xml.  If they don\u0027t specify a test runner I\u0027ll default to whatever Julien tells me to, and I can add a property to java_test to be able to set the test class explicitly if necessary.",

      "message": "If we can do this in Soong, let\u0027s do it there.\n\nHowever for which to default to: my guess is eventually we will want to do continuous runs of these tests in the lab infrastructure, correct? For those runs we use device-tests (built on device target builders) and general-tests (build on test_suites_* ABI-based builders).\n\nThe main reason I created null-suite is so atest could support many of the older unittests without manually updating their mks/bps to a device-test or general-test suite. My first PS for that CL I used general-tests and it exploded in size so I decided against packaging everything on the builders.\n\nSince this is a new test/build type I would be more supportive of defaulting these to general-tests. But I am okay with sticking to null_suite as long as we support overriding it in the bp files.\n\n\nAlso I commented on the bug, we\u0027ll likely eventually want 2 auto-generated configs for target/host but for now we should default to which one is higher priority. Let\u0027s discuss this point on the bug.",

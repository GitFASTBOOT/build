      "message": "From my naive view, it seems like we should be able to do better than always executing multiple commands for every project in the manifest.  Admittedly, I don\u0027t know python and don\u0027t know our build system, but to me it seems like forking off a shell process would be a relatively expensive command.  Perhaps I\u0027m overthinking this because it\u0027s super cheap?\n\nI would assume/hope that the versions of aapt2 which have different command line syntax also have a different version.  Naively, it seems like we should be able to run \"aapt2 version\", parse the output, and then know which command to run.\n\nIt\u0027s a matter of save ~90 shell subprocesses per every build invocation (at least for walleye).  I don\u0027t know if that ends up being such a trivial drop that it\u0027s not worth further optimization here.",

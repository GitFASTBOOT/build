Considering the motivation of bots is to find build failures before the build of end-developers fails, IMO fallback-for-developers-and-error-for-bots is the best option (fyi, this is how Chromium\u0027s build system is configured). However, I also understand setting GOMA_HERMETIC\u003derror on bots would be troublesome before goma on bots becomes stable. Maybe setting GOMA_HERMETIC\u003dfallback by default would be an option, but I\u0027m not sure.",

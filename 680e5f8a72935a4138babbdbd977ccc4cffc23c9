If so,\n- can you please remove misc_info.txt from the image archive for real devices? The archive is supposed to be used for flashing purpose. It\u0027s not a container to pack intermediate files.\n- dist \"misc_info.txt\" as a separate artifact, and ideally with a better name, such as super_misc_info.txt to avoid confusion.",

It seems due to the fact that imgdiff was shelling out to bsdiff (with system(3)) in very early release (D).\nhttps://android.googlesource.com/platform/build/+/donut-release2/tools/applypatch/imgdiff.c#629\n\nThat pattern has been removed since eclair: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/build/+/d98e0870426f7280d9a5b7a9ff5fa745e623b426, so it should be sufficient to only depend on the tool in need.",

      "message": "There are already some dependencies for `boot-debug.img` in â€‹device builds (not GSI build), and I\u0027m not sure if the gain worth the efforts.\n\ne.g.,\n go/flash supports flashing a boot-debug.img by clicking an option \"force_debuggable\", etc.\n\nCurrently the issue is that for GKI users, when they wanted to download a boot.img from a GSI target (GKI/GSI are built in \"gsi_arm64-user\" together for now), boot-debug.img might cause some confusions.\n\nBut it has no problem in \"device builds\".\n\nBasically this is just a transient solution in GSI targets (to fix the confusion for GKI boot.img download).\n\nWe have more discussions about GKI release in the future.\ne.g., \n\nb/197262350, b/200945738\n\nHope that clarifies.",

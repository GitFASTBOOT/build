      "message": "`BOARD_KERNEL_BINARIES :\u003d kernel-4.19-gz kernel-5.4 ...` specified in generic_arm64/BoardConfig.mk\nwould cause the build rule for GKI boot images to be generated automatically (boot-4.19-gz.img boot-5.4.img ...), however the boot images depend on the kernel artifacts, and the kernel artifacts build rules are defined in generic_arm64/device.mk, the PRODUCT_COPY_FILES lines this CL are trying to move.\n\nIMO it makes more sense for all the GKI related configs to be product config but board config. For example setting PRODUCT_KERNEL_BINARIES in product makefile would generate GKI boot images. But I feel like it\u0027s too big of a change to make at this point since so many things are depending on BOARD_KERNEL_BINARIES already.",

      "message": "I understand now. I agree, such dependency is messy ðŸ˜ž\n\nAlso, I think gki.mk is a bit misnomer; other devices that enables GKI should NOT inherit from gki.mk, since it installs to $OUT/kernel-*. They should install to $OUT/kernel instead. This is the same argument for b/177859525.\n\nWithout the benefit of reusing gki.mk on other devices, the only good thing about this change is improved readability. Also, you should be able to make generic_arm64/device.mk inherit from gki.mk directly, right?",

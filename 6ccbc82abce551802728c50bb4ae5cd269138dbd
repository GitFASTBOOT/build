      "message": "Hm, I\u0027ll have to take a look into the feasibliity of adding that next week.  The warnings that we see a lot are actually coming from a core breakpad library call that fprintf\u0027s directy to stderr, not from the dump_syms tool code.  So at a glance it didn\u0027t look like a trivial change to add a flag to dump_syms for these warnings.  And I uploaded this CL quickly as we have movers right now getting ready to move us to a different building, so I had to quickly upload this before shutting down my build machine for the weekend.",

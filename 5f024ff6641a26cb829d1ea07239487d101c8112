      "message": "Iiuc this enables CFI for com.android.media.swcodec. Do you need both directories to avoid a diff?\n\nIf it only enables CFI then it\u0027d be better to do that in the module rather than here. I.e. with\n\n  sanitizer {\n    cfi: true,\n  },\n\nin the cc_* modules that make up the APEX. I can imagine someone thought it was easier to set it in the product rather than adding those all over, though.\n\nI also see that enabling CFI has the side-effect to potentially enable installation of some vendor variant of VNDK libraries, but I doubt that\u0027s significant when building an APEX: https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:build/soong/cc/library.go;l\u003d1563;drc\u003dmaster\n\nStepping back, I wonder why a module wants to control this - call frames get enough info by default to make stack traces sensible, don\u0027t they? I\u0027m not familiar enough with CFI to understand what it adds beyond that. Can you find a reviewer that knows the context a bit more?",

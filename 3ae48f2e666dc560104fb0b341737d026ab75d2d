      "message": "I can\u0027t really follow what these CLs are doing, so I used go/compare-target-files to see what it actually changed, and it shows some strange results.  This CL and its parents seems to have removed `system/lib64/hw/android.hidl.memory@1.0-impl.so` and `vendor/lib64/hw/android.hidl.memory@1.0-impl.so` on cuttlefish devices, but added `vendor/lib64/hw/android.hidl.memory@1.0-impl.so` on pixel devices, maybe because it removed it from `vendor/apex/com.android.vndk.current.on_vendor.apex`?  Is that what you expected?",

I don\u0027t understand why they wouldn\u0027t have it installed when it was added unconditionally to `PRODUCT_PACKAGES` in `base_vendor.mk` before this CL. \nIf those pixel vendor dependencies were on vndk.current, then I guess it makes sense that they need to pull in the vendor variant instead, so I\u0027m not concerned about the change.",

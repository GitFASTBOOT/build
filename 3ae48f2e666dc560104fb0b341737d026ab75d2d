This CL and its parents seems to have removed `system/lib64/hw/android.hidl.memory@1.0-impl.so` and `vendor/lib64/hw/android.hidl.memory@1.0-impl.so` on cuttlefish devices, but added `vendor/lib64/hw/android.hidl.memory@1.0-impl.so` on pixel devices, maybe because it removed it from `vendor/apex/com.android.vndk.current.on_vendor.apex`?  Is that what you expected?",

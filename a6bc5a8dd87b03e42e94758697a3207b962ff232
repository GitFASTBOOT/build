      "message": "I\u0027d be surprised if this does anything, I\u0027d expect the semicolon to be on the next line after a tab for this to be considered a rule.\n\nIf you are going to do this (as opposed to just not using $(test_mapping_list) except in the $(file) function), put a comment explaining why this is necessary:\n\nm checkbuild does a check for dependencies on files in $(OUT_DIR) that do not have a rule to write them.  This file is written by soong_ui, so is always present when ninja runs.  Add a dummy rule that pretends to write the file so that it doesn\u0027t trip the dangling dependencies check.",

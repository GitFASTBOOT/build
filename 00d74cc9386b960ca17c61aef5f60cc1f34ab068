You get no errors at the dx level, and the javac level is not relevant because of things like \"shared libraries\" - the javac stage is sufficiently disconnected from the AoT stage to allow mismatch when not being careful with things like transitive dependencies (which is exactly why Colin asked - this check helped him in the past).",

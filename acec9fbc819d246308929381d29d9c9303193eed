      "message": "Ack, makes sense. One thing, is I\u0027d like to communicate to the user that the device needs to reboot to apply the flag, since it\u0027s a common confusion. Maybe we can just rely on the help text for that here.\n\nActually, how about I\u0027ll communicate that the flag is \"staged,\" in the list/read commands. Turning this into a bit of a rabbithole, there isn\u0027t an easy way to tell in AOSP right now; the staging and boot-stable logic is still only internal, although the codegen caching is external, so a reboot is still required to refresh that value. How about we just rely on helptext now; and then once we get the new storage in, we can showcase clearly that a flag is staged in the list/read commands.",

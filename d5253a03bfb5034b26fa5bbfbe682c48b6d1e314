      "message": "Caveat: not an expert on presubmit and TEST_MAPPING.\n\naconfig.test used to be part of presubmit, and from what I understood it was automatically picked up because there was no TEST_MAPPING file. If adding this file doesn\u0027t remove aconfig.test from presubmit, stop reading now.\n\nIf adding this file *does* remove aconfig.test from presubmit, I want aconfig.test to be mentioned in TEST_MAPPING as well as FlagAnnotationTests.\n\nReplacing line 7 with \u0027\"name\": \"aconfig.test\"\u0027 and running atest --test-mapping makes atest think aconfig.test is a device test:\n\n`Running 1 tests that require device.`\n \nThis is not true; aconfig.test are host tests (soong module type rust_test_host). I don\u0027t know how to fix this. Any advice?",

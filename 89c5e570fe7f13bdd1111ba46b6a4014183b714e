      "message": "This is not a good predicate. Not only because cf may run on arm64 (so the name could be cf_arm64), but also that the feature is limited to cuttlefish. Plus, this is device specific code in platform.\n\nRather, you should define a new PRODUCT variable that describes this specific behavior (e.g. PRODUCT_OTA_GEN_DOWNGRADE_PARTIAL), put it in misc_info.txt, and read it here; and define the variable for cuttlefish under device/google/cuttlefish/shared/device.mk.\n\nWhen you have this flag enabled, you can automatically generate it by adding new rules to core/Makefile, similar to the retrofit DAP OTA (look for otardppackage)",

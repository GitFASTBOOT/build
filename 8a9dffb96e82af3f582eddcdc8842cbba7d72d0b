      "message": "Do we foresee any problems with symlinks used in Makefiles ? I wasn\u0027t sure if there are any build issues related to it.\n\nThe main reason to use symlink here is for backward compatibility. All T launch devices have used `android_t_baseline.mk` - Initially, I just made changes to `android_t_baseline.mk` by adding new fields; but the naming is bit confusing as we have to mention using `android_t_baselinke.mk` for all U launch devices. \n\nHence, as a generic name, we prefer to use `vabc_features.mk` for all virtual A/B related. Thus, going further all U+ launch devices can use the `vabc_features.mk` and all older devices which had `android_t_baseline.mk` will continue to build without any build break.",

      "message": "This exemption is necessary only if RRO refers/uses\n 1. @hide marked frameworks resource defined in public.xml\n 2. resources of the target app which uses hidden API(because of link type check even though RRO doesn\u0027t contain any code)\n\nWhat I plan to do roughly is\n 1. check if there is really usage of framework\u0027s @hide resource from RRO.\n 2. support @SystemApi or @hide in public.xml of an arbitrary app which exports their resource as java_sdk_library does for java library.\n\nAfter two things are done, I think we can delete this exemption.

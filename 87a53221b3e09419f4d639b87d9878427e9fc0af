      "message": "swetland and I would prefer if you removed the abstraction here and just dealt with cflags, like:\n\narch_cflags :\u003d -march\u003d$(TARGET_ARCH_VERSION) -mtune\u003darm920 -D__ARM_ARCH_4__\n\nThis will give us more flexibility in case a given architecture wants to define more than just -mtune and -D args.  (arch_cflags, in this case, is essentially local to this file and thus would be in lowercase)\n\nOf course, this makes it a little messier to override TARGET_CPU, but you could still do it like:\n\nifneq ($(strip $(TARGET_CPU)),)\n  arch_cflags :\u003d -mtune\u003d$(TARGET_CPU) $(filter-out -mtune\u003d%,$(arch_cflags)) \nendif",

It might make sense to let a particular board set the -mtune cflag, and leave -mtune completely out of linux-arm.mk. I still think linux-arm.mk should take care of architecture version differences though, as there are going to many boards with the same architecture, but in reality there is very few things in user land that care about the particular TARGET_CPU.\n\nTo this end, I\u0027m going to leave -mtune more-or-less hard coded as it is at the moment, and a further patch can fix this if it is useful.",

      "message": "There\u0027re two \"super.img\"s:\n* one under $(PRODUCT_OUT), i.e. INSTALLED_SUPERIMAGE_TARGET;\n* the other INTERNAL_SUPERIMAGE_DIST_TARGET.\n\nWith BOARD_BUILD_SUPER_IMAGE_BY_DEFAULT set to true, both will be built, but still it\u0027s INTERNAL_SUPERIMAGE_DIST_TARGET that gets dist\u0027d. Then the change here leads to inconsistency: INTERNAL_SUPERIMAGE_DIST_TARGET is dist\u0027d along with the \"super_misc_info.txt\" for INSTALLED_SUPERIMAGE_TARGET.\n\nBased on the code, I think currently the only difference between the two \"misc_info.txt\" lies in the \"*_image\u003d...\" lines? And I guess those lines have to be replaced when re-generating the super.img? If so, can we dist the super_misc_info.txt for INTERNAL_SUPERIMAGE_DIST_TARGET?\n\n(Also the change should stay closer to L4590.)",

      "message": "Why hex instead of octal here? (At least this appears to be the file type/mode which is normally represented in octal).\n\nThe group and other permissions are likely going to change from machine to machine depending on what the umask is set to -- it\u0027s definitely not standardized on our fleet. Can we make sure the program using these files ignores/standardizes the group/other permissions?\n\nThat being said, 0700 doesn\u0027t seem like a great default for symlinks, so feel free to change this or file a bug against me.",

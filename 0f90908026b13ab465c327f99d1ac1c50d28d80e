      "message": "What process do people currently use to discover which properties are available for a particular Makefile? Is it a mix of copying from other Makefiles, browsing clear_vars.mk, and asking you and Colin for suggestions?\n\nBasically I wonder whether someday in the future we want a directory of integration tests that users can browse to see examples of how to use various pieces of functionality\n\nI\u0027ve been spending a while trying to figure out \"Does LOCAL_PREBUILT_COVERAGE_ARCHIVE get used in the project building the prebuilt or the project using the prebuilt? Is it a comma-separated list of all the archives or does it only support one? Is it an absolute file path or is it relative based on some root?\" I think (based on the comments at the top of this file) that it\u0027s a single file path, relative from the Makefile that it includes it, that references the .gcnodir file that corresponds to the dependency prebuilt, but I\u0027m not completely sure.",

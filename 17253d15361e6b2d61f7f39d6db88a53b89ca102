      "message": "Questions:\n\n1) Why does this need to build a zip if you\u0027re just uploading a single file?\n2) Since this is for test mapping, why not just add the new file into the test mapping zip you already create?\n\nI.E. I\u0027m trying to suggest instead of creating a new object to upload and adding logic to download it, just package it with the other artifacts you use to decide which tests to run?\n\nUnless this is used at a different time?",

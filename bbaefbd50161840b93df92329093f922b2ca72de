      "message": "This whole section isn\u0027t really correct.  tapas is somewhat orthogonal to building against the SDK.  tapas tells the build system that you are building a portable app, and not building images for a device.  In most cases that also means compiling against the SDK, but there are unbundled apps that compile against system APIs too.  The subset of projects is mostly a convenience for shorter sync and build times.",

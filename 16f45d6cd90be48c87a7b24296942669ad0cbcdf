      "message": "What I\u0027d like to see is:\n1) this makefile containing the right PRODUCT_ variables that triggers the system.img behavior we want for mainline\n2) the _my_paths variable to contain the paths matching #1\n\nPut another way: $ lunch mainline_system_arm64 \u0026\u0026 make should produce a system.img which includes all the files this list includes.\n\nThis was true prior to https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/build/+/728287/23/core/config.mk. Before that CL, PRODUCT_SHIPPING_API_LEVEL :\u003d 28 implied system-as-root (via PRODUCT_FULL_TREBLE), but this is no longer enforced.\n\nIt might still be accurate, I\u0027m not sure. I\u0027m happy for you to submit this if it\u0027s blocking things, but we need to resolve this - I\u0027ll try to catch you on chat this evening.",

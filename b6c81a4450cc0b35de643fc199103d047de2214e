      "message": "Let me explain more on this.\nensure_start ensures goma compiler_proxy is already running with *the same environment* goma compiler_proxy is started in the last time.  If not (i.e. environment has been changed), it automatically restarts.\n\nWhen we develop goma compiler_proxy, we need to make goma compiler_proxy connect to development server.  For that purpose, we use the option that is not relevant to set with goma_ctl.py. (we use yet another script for developers to start compiler_proxy in this case)\n\nHowever, even if we start goma compiler_proxy with \"developer option\" with special script, current \"USE_GOMA\u003d1 m\" always restart compiler_proxy because \"goma_ctl.py ensure_start\" in goma.mk always think environment has changed.\n\n\nAs a result, when I fixed b/31170252#comment16, I need to remove code goma_ctl.py ensure_start to avoid the issue above.  However, I believe such temporary removal of code for debugging the feature is error-prone, and I would like to make goma.mk to have a option for that purpose.\n\nWhat do you think?",

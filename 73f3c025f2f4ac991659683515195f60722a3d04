      "message": "I was trying to filter out the bootclasspath libraries that were already in the system modules; the set of libraries that make up PRIVATE_SYSTEM_MODULES is sadly not easy to reconstruct - got any idea? But since everything uses core-system-modules which consists of core-oj, core-libart, core-lambda-stubs, I\u0027ve now hard-coded core-oj core-libart core-lambda-stubs here; where would I define a constant with that list if I wanted to share it between here and the core-system-modules rule in JavaLibray.bp?\n\n(Exception: There is also core-all-system-modules, but that\u0027s only used when building core-oj, core-libart and core-lambda-stubs themselves, which do not depend on each other so the filter-out should have no effect / be harmless there).\n\nSuggestions for improving this?",

Or do you guys have some other design around 64-bit file sizes/offsets? adb isn\u0027t totally 64-bit size/offset clean (due to file_sync_service.h being 32-bit), but I have read that people are using adb to push \u003e4GB files on Windows.",

      "message": "I think adb uses \u0027stat\u0027 which sys/stat.h maps to a 64-bit api \u0026 structure if _FILE_OFFSET_BITS\u003d\u003d64. I checked and sizeof(((struct stat*)0)-\u003est_size) \u003d\u003d 8 in Windows builds. Some references to st_size just (incorrectly) truncate to 32-bit, but it seems like some may use it correctly (as a param to pm install-create, which might be broken by this change?).\n\nHere\u0027s a user that is adb pull\u0027ing \u003e4GiB files: https://productforums.google.com/d/msg/nexus/stu63KZzXb8/ki8KOh72AnIJ\n\nI think the reason that the code works in practice is because the sync code only uses the size in determining if a file is different, it doesn\u0027t use it for determining how much to read/write.",

      "message": "I\u0027m setting up a PDK for a partner who doesn\u0027t have access to the NDK translation source, so I wanted them to fall back to using the prebuilts. Though it turns out we can\u0027t share the prebuilts with all our partners (yet), so I can\u0027t actually use this change. Instead I went with the following: https://googleplex-android-review.git.corp.google.com/c/device/google/desktop/common/+/28784804\n\n\u003e they make it impossible to reproduce builds from an external source tree (aosp, partners, etc) in main.\n\n\nI\u0027ve learned this the hard way :/ Creating a PDK has been challenging. Maybe the best thing to do is to split my target? i.e., brya -\u003e aosp_brya, partner_brya, brya (internal version). Though, I\u0027m not sure how to enforce that `aosp_` only uses AOSP sources. What target do partners typically build?",

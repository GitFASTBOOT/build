      "message": "Hi Szuwei and Jiyong,\n\nI realized that aosp/1707468 alone is insufficient for disabling the build-time debugfs restrictions for GSI builds since we will shortly set launch API level to 31 on GSI builds too(which will then cause PRODUCT_SET_DEBUGFS_RESTRICTIONS to be set to true for the target). Run-time restrictions would continue to be enabled on S launch devices running GSI builds. Please do take a look and let me know your thoughts. Thanks again!\n\nRegards,\nHridya",

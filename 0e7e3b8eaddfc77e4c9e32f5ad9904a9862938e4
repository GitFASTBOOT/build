I\u0027d recommend not building any new infrastructure around it, as it is impossible to tell from the values what the user intended to do with the dependency.  In Soong we have \"runtime_libs\", which is specific to shared libraries that are loaded at runtime.  I\u0027d suggest propagating that value to Make and then to module-info.json.",

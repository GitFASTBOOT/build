Last time I was part of the conversations about adding bazel() to envsetup, I was under the impression we were not going to suggest to users that they should use something other than `m`. If they wanted to use bazel mode, they would use `USE_BAZEL\u003d1 m`, and they would never invoke `abazel` or `bazel` directly. What changed?\n2. Why do we prefer `bazel` to `abazel` here? We have a good reason to be concerned users might be confused that it overrides the normal system `bazel` if you\u0027ve sourced envsetup. Even with a disclaimer: why add to the potential confusion?",

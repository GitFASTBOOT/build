Have I missed anything that might break with this change?\n\nCurrently `sdk_phone_arm64` fails to compile for me with the error mentioned in the commit message, and with this CL it builds and runs successfully (although I did have to make a couple of minor fixes in `external/qemu` to get this working on x86 hosts: aosp/2758345, aosp/2759488).",

That is, if we have a  list of \u003cfrom\u003e:\u003cto\u003e pairs to be the value of, say $(INHERITANCE_GRAPH), all the remaining stuff on lines 85-91  of build/make/core/product-graph.mk can be moved to build/make/tools/filter-product-graph.py, to which we will feed this $(INHERITANCE_GRAPH) as input.\nThen, for makefile-based config INHERITANCE_GRAPH is set via something similar to lines 88-89, and for the Starlark-based config is be set fairly simply when executing inheritance).

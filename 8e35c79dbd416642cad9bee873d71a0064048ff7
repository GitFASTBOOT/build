      "message": "What problem is this solving? Why does project mainline suddenly necessitate adding ever more partitions? What is preventing you from keeping (APEX) components on /system? Or /data?\n\nIt\u0027s not only the addition of new partitions that baffles me, but rather the increasing velocity of adding them. [^1]\n\nAren\u0027t you worried you\u0027re gonna trip up over all that complexity? Android is already assembled at runtime out of a an excessive number of moving parts, do you want to add even more to the mix?\n\nI know that with DAP you *can* create partitions \"for free\" now, but do you really have to? Your test matrices are going to expand to approach a singularity.\n\nAlso, while you\u0027re at it, mind taking a look at this proposal that will instead actually be beneficial? https://android-review.googlesource.com/q/topic:%2522gms_partition%2522\n\n[^1]: This is getting pretty crazy https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/fe991623f0d76677076bbe041b26838cd63ffc2b/fastboot/fastboot.cpp#142",

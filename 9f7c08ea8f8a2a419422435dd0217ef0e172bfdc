We don\u0027t want to regenerate the ninja files when switching between regular and dist builds, and ninja doesn\u0027t handle dependencies on environment variables well.\n\nI can only think of hacky solutions like having soong_ui write out a file that changes between dist and non dist builds, make the file a dependency of the image generation rules, and extract the flag from there.  That would force the images to rebuild when switching from a regular build to dist, but that\u0027s probably OK.",

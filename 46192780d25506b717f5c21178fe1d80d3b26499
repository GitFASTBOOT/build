      "message": "It looks like this might be overly aggressive as is.\n\n`lunch` ends up breaking with this.  That can be \"fixed\" by changing the `print_lunch_menu` logic in `build/make/envsetup.sh` to use `TARGET_RELEASE\u003dnext` in its call to `get_build_var`.  But that\u0027s unlikely to be the only similar usage.\n\nWe give an error (in a different place) with a `lunch` target like `mokey-trunk_staging-bogus`.  I\u0027ll look into moving the \"unset\" error near that logic.",

It will likely go away sooner than later, but isn\u0027t the installed_notice_file just the notice for the current module copied where it later gets grouped into system versus vendor etc. NOTICE.xmlgz ?\n\nIn that case, it would have no reason to depend on the license metadata.",

That made both the host and device notice files depend on the same .meta_lic, so I moved it here so the module\u0027s notice file depends only on the module\u0027s .meta_lic file.\n\nI don\u0027t know why the notice file depends on the .meta_lic file at all, since it is not used, I assumed it was to make sure the .meta_lic files were generated, and would later be used for the notice file rule.",

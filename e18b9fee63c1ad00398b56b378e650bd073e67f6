      "message": "Hmm, the public sdk release would use `next` and the google3 sdk drop uses `trunk_staging`, so these two would be what I would be curious about. I don\u0027t think that the CI builds would ever pass `MODULE_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE\u003dfalse` for `sdk` builds, but I\u0027m more curious about the user experience for local builds.\n\nIIUC as of now (before this change) even if a user sets `MODULE_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE\u003dfalse`, sdk builds will be built from source. Would this change be changing that logic? Please correct me if I am wrong.",

The build flags for `trunk_staging` and `next` have both been configured to use the source java_sdk_library and not the prebuilt java_sdk_library library. `trunk_staging` and `next` will have a different set of aconfig flag values, both these come from source.\n\n\u003e Would this change be changing that logic?\n\nThe prior mentioned behavior will remain the same after this CL. From the perspective of docs and sdk, `MODULE_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE` has no effect in these two release configuratrions since apex_contributions [supersede](https://source.corp.google.com/h/googleplex-android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:build/soong/android/prebuilt.go;l\u003d680-683;bpv\u003d1) `prefer` property.",

      "message": "Hmm, the public sdk release would use `next` and the google3 sdk drop uses `trunk_staging`, so these two would be what I would be curious about. I don\u0027t think that the CI builds would ever pass `MODULE_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE\u003dfalse` for `sdk` builds, but I\u0027m more curious about the user experience for local builds.\n\nIIUC as of now (before this change) even if a user sets `MODULE_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE\u003dfalse`, sdk builds will be built from source. Would this change be changing that logic? Please correct me if I am wrong.",

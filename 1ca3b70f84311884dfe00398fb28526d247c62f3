      "message": "Ack. My concern is more about users that would set this thinking they\u0027d get a static STL. Then again, the users of a static STL on the host should be very few and far between (probably won\u0027t go beyond adb and fastboot), so maybe this isn\u0027t much of an issue.\n\nWindows support for libc++ should be available in the near future, so maybe that\u0027s yet another reason to not worry about this.",
